# Monolithic Architecture Projects on AWS

Welcome to the Monolithic Architecture Projects repository for AWS! This collection features a set of projects showcasing monolithic system architectures designed to run on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. Each project is crafted to provide practical insights into different deployment scenarios.

## Projects

1. **Project Single Node Architecture**
   - *Description:* A simple monolithic architecture designed to run on a single AWS instance. This project serves as a starting point for understanding the basic structure of a monolithic system.

2. **Project Multi-Node Architecture with HA and Failover**
   - *Description:* Explore the robustness of a monolithic architecture by deploying it across multiple nodes with High Availability (HA) and failover mechanisms. This project demonstrates how to enhance the reliability of a monolithic system in a distributed environment.

3. **Project Merging Sites in One Server**
   - *Description:* Learn how to consolidate multiple sites into a single server in a monolithic architecture. This project focuses on the efficiency gains and resource optimization achieved by hosting multiple applications on a unified infrastructure.

4. **Project Multi-Node Architecture with HA and Failover (Redux)**
   - *Description:* A variant of the Multi-Node Architecture project, this version emphasizes different aspects or configurations. Explore additional options and gain a deeper understanding of deploying monolithic architectures in a highly available and fault-tolerant manner.

5. **Project Proxy Pass Through Webserver to Tomcat Server**
   - *Description:* Dive into the intricacies of routing and proxying in a monolithic architecture. This project illustrates how to set up a web server to act as a proxy, directing traffic to a Tomcat server, and explores the benefits of such configurations in a monolithic environment.

## Getting Started

Follow the specific instructions in each project's directory to set up and deploy the respective monolithic architecture. Detailed documentation and step-by-step guides are provided to facilitate a smooth experience.
