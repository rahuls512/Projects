Monolithic Architecture Projects on AWS
This repository showcases a collection of Monolithic Architecture projects designed to run on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. Each project is carefully crafted to demonstrate various aspects of monolithic system architecture, providing practical insights into different deployment scenarios.

Projects
Project Single Node Architecture

Description: A simple monolithic architecture designed to run on a single AWS instance. This project serves as a starting point for understanding the basic structure of a monolithic system.
Project Multi-Node Architecture with HA and Failover

Description: Explore the robustness of a monolithic architecture by deploying it across multiple nodes with High Availability (HA) and failover mechanisms. This project demonstrates how to enhance the reliability of a monolithic system in a distributed environment.
Project Merging Sites in One Server

Description: Learn how to consolidate multiple sites into a single server in a monolithic architecture. This project focuses on the efficiency gains and resource optimization achieved by hosting multiple applications on a unified infrastructure.
Project Multi-Node Architecture with HA and Failover (Redux)

Description: A variant of the Multi-Node Architecture project, this version emphasizes different aspects or configurations. Explore additional options and gain a deeper understanding of deploying monolithic architectures in a highly available and fault-tolerant manner.
Project Proxy Pass Through Webserver to Tomcat Server

Description: Dive into the intricacies of routing and proxying in a monolithic architecture. This project illustrates how to set up a web server to act as a proxy, directing traffic to a Tomcat server, and explores the benefits of such configurations in a monolithic environment.
